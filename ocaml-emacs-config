;; Some tips for configuring opam:
;; Use opam switch to select a proper ocaml version
;; After changing to a new ocaml version, it seems that all the packages need to be installed.

;; Configure tuareg
;; 1. opam install tuareg
;; 2. When tuareg finishes installation, it tells you how to configure emacs
(load "/Users/dj8617/.opam/4.06.1/share/emacs/site-lisp/tuareg-site-file")

;; Configure merlin
;; 1. opam install merlin
;; 2. When merlin finishes installation, it tells you how to configure emacs
(let ((opam-share (ignore-errors (car (process-lines "opam" "config" "var" "share")))))
  (when (and opam-share (file-directory-p opam-share))
    ;; Register Merlin
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "emacs/site-lisp" opam-share))
    (autoload 'merlin-mode "merlin" nil t nil)
    ;; Automatically start it in OCaml buffers
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
    (add-hook 'caml-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
    ;; Use opam switch to lookup ocamlmerlin binary
    (setq merlin-command 'opam)))
